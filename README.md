Task 1:
1. Examine Transaction Data
Objectives:
Identify inconsistencies, missing data, and outliers.
Ensure correct categorization of items and verify numeric data across all tables.
Actions:
Correct any anomalies found in the dataset.
Save the cleaned dataset to facilitate accurate analysis.
2. Examine Customer Data
Objectives:
Check for null values and other issues in customer data.
Actions:
Merge transaction and customer datasets once satisfied with data quality.
Save files regularly throughout the process to maintain data integrity.
3. Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation
Objectives:
Define key metrics such as total sales and sales drivers.
Identify sources of high sales.
Actions:
Explore the data thoroughly and create charts and graphs to visualize findings.
Document interesting trends and insights for inclusion in a report to Julia.
4. Deep Dive into Customer Segments
Objectives:
Formulate recommendations based on insights gathered from the analysis.
Identify target customer segments and assess the relevance of packet sizes.
Actions:
Draw overall conclusions based on the analysis results.
Final Steps
Save all analyses in CSV format along with visualizations for reporting purposes.
Aim to submit initial findings by the end of next week.


Task2:
Objective
Analyze the monthly sales experience of each store using the QVI_data dataset to compare trial stores with control stores based on key performance metrics.
Key Metrics to Analyze
Total Sales Revenue
Total Number of Customers
Average Number of Transactions per Customer
Steps to Conduct the Analysis
1. Data Preparation
Utilize the QVI_data dataset or the output from Task 1.
Ensure data is cleaned and structured for analysis.
2. Function Creation
Write a function to streamline the analysis process for each trial store, reducing redundancy.
Consider using statistical methods such as:
Pearson Correlation: To assess relationships between variables.
3. Control Store Selection
Identify appropriate control stores for comparison with each trial store.
4. Comparative Analysis
Compare each trial store with its corresponding control store during the trial period.
Test for significant differences in total sales between trial and control pairs.
Investigate whether changes in total sales are driven by:
An increase in purchasing customers.
A higher number of purchases per customer.
Final Steps
Compile initial findings and save your analysis code as a PDF file.
